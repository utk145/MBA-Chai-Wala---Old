1. A div can be used as an overlay to stop the videos getting downloaded  by users. Like this - 
old mba chai-wala clone\old_mine\src\components\IntoBannerVideo.jsx 




2. The shorthand font property with basic attributes used is as follows:

` font: font-style font-variant font-weight font-size/line-height font-family; `

For example:

font: italic small-caps bold 16px/1.5 Arial, sans-serif;

This sets the font-style to italic, font-variant to small-caps, font-weight to bold, font-size to 16px, line-height to 1.5, and font-family to Arial and sans-serif as fallback.
